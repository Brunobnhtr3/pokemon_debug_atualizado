# pokemon-debug

Scripts to compile, decompile and modify the scripts of popular Pokemon fan games made with MKXP/Pokemon Essentials. Currently supports [Pokemon Desolation](desolation), [Pokemon Flux](flux), [Pokemon Rejuvenation](rejuvenation), [Pokemon Uranium](uranium), and [Pokemon Xenoverse](xenoverse).

I added a step by step guide to the Docx file, and added the extract_scripts.rb files to extract the Scripts.rxdata file and the program to extract Rgssad without bugs.
Adicionei um passo a passo no arquivo Docx, e adicionei os arquivos extract_scripts.rb para fazer a extração do Arquivo Scripts.rxdata e o programa para extrair o Rgssad sem Bugs.
