# Pokemon Desolation

Pokemon Desolation puts its Ruby scripts directly in the `Scripts` directory of the game's installation folder.

Contains patches for implementing a Pokemon debug menu, a debug menu, [Crests](https://rejuvenation.wiki.gg/wiki/Crests), and multi-abilities in Pokemon Desolation. To use them, install [`git`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to apply a patch.

```sh
make pokemon-debug-menu debug-menu crests multi-ability POKEMON_DESOLATION=path/to/pokemon/desolation
```
