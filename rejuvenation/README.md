# Pokemon Rejvenation

Pokemon Rejvenation puts its Ruby scripts directly in the `Scripts` directory of the game's installation folder.

Contains patches for implementing a Pokemon debug menu and a debug menu. To use them, install [`git`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to apply a patch.

```sh
make pokemon-debug-menu debug-menu POKEMON_REJUVENATION=path/to/pokemon/rejuvenation
```
